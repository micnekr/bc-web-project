    <h2 class="center-text">Introduction: why should I care?</h2>

    <p>
      HTML is a web standard that was created in 1993, which was
      <!-- Make sure to display something as a placeholder before the js loads-->
      <span id="html-creation-date-display">a long time</span> ago, in the age when the web was completely different.
      And I mean <em>completely</em>. Back then, there were only 15 million Internet users, compared to the <span
        style="color:#f46262;">5 billion</span>
      today.
    </p>

    <p>JavaScript, on the other hand, was created in <strong>just 10 days</strong>, 2 years after HTML's inception.
      Because so much of
      the web relies on its functionality, it is very hard to change its existing functionality and to address
      the poor design choices. For example, <code>document.write()</code>, one of the functions that is taught to people
      learning JavaScript, is discouraged even by the <a
        href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html#document.write()"> HTML spec</a>
      itself!</p>
    <img src="img/document_write_discouraged_by_mozilla.png" class="center-img" />
    <p>Moreover, this function replaces all the contents of the webpage with the supplied HTML, which is hardly useful
      if you want to modify a small piece of text.</p>
    <input id="document-write-button" type="button" value="Run 'document.write()'"></input>
    <p>Maybe it is time for us to move on from these standards?
    </p>

    <h2 class="center-text">Chapter 1: code reuse</h2>
    <p>Most modern programming languages offer a way to reuse code via functions, classes or other similar constructs.
      It would be great if there was a similar idea in HTML and JavaScript that would allow you to write some part of a
      page and reuse it later, without rewriting much HTML or JavaScript. Consider the following code:
    </p>
    <code id="form-component-example-html-code" class="block code-example-display"></code>
    <p>This code produces the following HTML:</p>
    <div id="form-component-example-html" class="code-example-source">
      <h3>Login</h3>
      <form>
        <label for="username">Your username:</label>
        <input type="text" name="username" id="username-input"></input>
        <label for="password">Your password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" id="password-input"></input>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" id="form-submit"></input>
      </form>
    </div>

    <p>Now I want to make a signup page, which has the same contents, but with a header saying "Signup" and not "Login".
      Plain JavaScript and HTML encourage the programmers to duplicate the code and not reuse it - there is no built-in
      construct to reuse DOM nodes in HTML. JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue and Svelte address this by allowing
      users to define components. Components act similarly to functions, being able to take in properties and generate
      DOM from a "template". These components also have some JavaScript associated with them, allowing some of the
      reactive logic to be contained in the component.
    </p>
    <p>For example, in this case, it is possible to define a component <code>CredentialsForm</code> which takes in a
      <code>header</code> parameter and inserts that text into the header. Then, the login and signup pages could be
      defined as follows:
    </p>
    <code class="block">
      &lt;CredentialsForm header="Login" /&gt;
    </code>
    <p>and</p>
    <code class="block">
      &lt;CredentialsForm header="Signup" /&gt;
    </code>
    <p>This also allows the application to be broken down into multiple chunks that can be worked on independently, as
      opposed to writing complex modern pages in a single HTML file.</p>

    <h2 class="center-text">Chapter 2: declarative display of text</h2>
    <p>It is common for applications to want to change some text to reflect the value of some variable. For example, a
      banking app might fetch the balance and want to display it on the page, keeping it updated as the user transfers
      money to a different account. With plain JavaScript, every time the variable is updated, we need to remember to
      select the corresponding DOM elements and set their values accordingly. JavaScript frameworks replace this
      error-prone imperative approach with a declarative approach. For example, the following code in Svelte
      automatically updates the displayed value when the variable is changed:</p>
    <code class="block">
      &lt;p&gt; Your balance is: {balance} pounds &lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
    <p>Compare this to a plain JavaScript implementation:</p>
    <code class="block">
      &lt;script&gt;
      function updateBalance(newBalance){
      balance = newBalance;
      document.getElementById("balance").innerText = balance;
      }
      &lt;/script&gt;

      &lt;p&gt; Your balance is: &lt;span id="balance"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pounds &lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
    <p>And don't forget to call this function any time you are changing the variable!</p>

    <p>There is also a related issue that modern JavaScript frameworks solve. Do you remember when I said that being
      able to display arbitrary HTML on a webpage is not a good thing? This is because an attacker can easily execute
      arbitrary JavaScript and do almost anything with the browser, such as stealing account information or logging
      passwords. There are many ways of achieving this, such as by including
      <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags or even tampering with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> attributes. This attack is known
      as Cross-Site Scripting, or XSS for short.
    </p>
    <p>It is hard to list all the possible cases that might be exploited and filter them manually using plain
      JavaScript. Fortunately, most modern frameworks default to inserting the text literally, and not as HTML.</p>
